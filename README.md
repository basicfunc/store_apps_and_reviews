# Google Play Store App Analysis
## Introduction
The Android app market is constantly growing, with thousands of new apps being developed every day. Many of these apps are easy to create and can be lucrative, making them an attractive option for developers. In this project, we will do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. We will also use user review data to determine how people feel about these apps through sentiment analysis.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x (I used 3.10)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python Libraries: `pandas, matplotlib, numpy, plotly, seaborn`

## Data
The data for this project was obtained from the Google Play Store. It includes information on over ten thousand apps, including their category, rating, and number of reviews. The user review data includes the review text, as well as a rating for the app.

## Analysis
We will begin by importing the necessary libraries and reading in the data. Then, we will explore the data to get a better understanding of the distribution of apps and their ratings. We will also create visualizations to better understand the relationship between different variables.

Next, we will perform sentiment analysis on the user reviews to determine how positive or negative the reviews are. We will use this information to see if there is a correlation between the sentiment of the reviews and the overall rating of the app.

Finally, we will use the results of our analysis to make recommendations for app developers on how to improve their app and increase its chances of success in the Google Play Store.

## Conclusion
By completing this project, we have gained a better understanding of the Android app market and how users feel about the apps available on the Google Play Store. We have also learned how to perform sentiment analysis and use it to make recommendations to app developers.
